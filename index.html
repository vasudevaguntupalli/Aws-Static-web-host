      Welcome to the quick guide on how to host a static website on AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service).
      
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      
      If you need to host a static website inexpensively, AWS S3 offers an easy, fast, and cost-effective solution. With AWS S3, you only pay for the storage you use, and you can even get up to 5GB of storage free of charge for a year within the AWS Free Tier.
      
      <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
      
      <h3>Follow these steps to host your static website on AWS S3:</h3>
      
      <h4>Access AWS Console</h4>
         
      Go to your AWS console and search for "S3" in the search bar, then select "S3" when it appears.
      
      <h4>1. Create a Domain</h4>

      -> Create/Purchase a domain name using Amazon Route 53 Open AWS Console and Navigate to Amazon Route 53 dashboard.<br>
      -> Click on Register Domain<br>
      -> Search if your Domain is available and add it to your cart<br>
      -> Enter your details and accept the terms and conditions<br>
      -> Don't forget to disable automatic renewal<br>

      <h4>2. Create a Bucket</h4>
      
      -> Click on "Create bucket."<br>
      -> Provide a unique "Bucket name" for your website.
      
      <h4>3. Configure Bucket Settings</h4>
      
      -> Unselect "Block all public access" to allow internet users to access your website.<br>
      -> Click on "Create bucket" at the bottom.
      
      <h4>4. Select Your Bucket</h4>
      
      Once created, select your bucket from the list.
      
      <h4>5. Configure Static Web Hosting</h4>
      
      -> Under the "Properties" tab, scroll down to "Static web hosting" and click on "Edit."<br>
      -> Click on "Enable" and select "Host a static website." Choose the default home page (index document) for your site.
      
      <h4>6. Set Up Error Handling (Optional)</h4>
      
      -> Enter the names of the index document and error document (if needed), then click "Save changes."
      
      <h4>7. Endpoint Creation</h4>
      
      When "Static website hosting" is enabled, the bucket endpoint is created.
      
      <h4>8. Bucket Policy for File Access</h4>
      
      -> Create a bucket policy to enable access to the files.<br>
      -> Navigate to the "Permissions" tab and under the "Bucket policy" section, enter the provided policy, ensuring to change the Resource to your bucket's ARN followed by "/*".
      
      <h4>9. Upload Your Website</h4>
      
      Create and upload your website files, including the "index.html" file as specified in step 8.
      
      <h4>10.Final Configuration</h4>
      
      -> Navigate to the "Properties" tab and load the bucket's endpoint. The "index.html" file will serve as the home page.<br>
      -> In case of an error (e.g., the index file is not available), the "error.html" page will be returned at the endpoint.
      
      <h4>Sample Website Pages</h4>
      
      The article includes sample website pages for your reference:<br>
      
      -> index.html: A basic static web page with AWS S3-themed content.<br>
      -> error.html: A custom error page (404) for handling missing files.
      
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      
      With these steps, you can easily host your static website on AWS S3, benefiting from its simplicity, speed, and cost-effectiveness. Have fun hosting your website!<br>
